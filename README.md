# Placify - Placement Predictor

📌 Project Overview
Placify is a machine learning model that predicts whether a student will get placed based on various factors using Logistic Regression. This project provides insights into placement probabilities based on input features like CGPA, and other relevant attributes.

🚀 Features

Uses Logistic Regression for binary classification.
Takes student details as input and predicts placement chances.
Data preprocessing and visualization for better insights.
Simple yet effective approach for career guidance.

🛠 Installation
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib mlxtend

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing student details such as:
CGPA
Number of internships
Technical skills rating
Soft skills rating
Extracurricular involvement

🔍 How to Use
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/placify.git
cd placify
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
jupyter notebook Placify.ipynb

Input student details and get placement predictions.
📈 Model Performance
The Logistic Regression model achieves high accuracy on the dataset.
Decision boundaries and feature importance are visualized using mlxtend.

🎯 Future Enhancements
